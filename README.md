## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Cryptography* consists a part of the science known as *Cryptology*. The other part is *Cryptanalysis*. There are a lot of different algorithms/mechanisms used in Cryptography. The scope of these laboratory works is to get familiar with some examples of each kind.

## Laboratory Works Tasks

### Lab 1 - Intro to Cryptography. Classical ciphers.
1. Get familiar with the basics of cryptography and classical ciphers.

2. Implement 4 types of the classical ciphers:
    - Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution (as explained above),
    - Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution, and a permutation of the alphabet,
    - Vigenere cipher,
    - Playfair cipher.
